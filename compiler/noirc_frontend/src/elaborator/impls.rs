//! Inherent type implementations collection and method declaration.
//!
//! This module handles the collection phase of impl blocks, where methods are declared
//! and registered in their appropriate modules. This is distinct from elaboration, where
//! method bodies are resolved and type-checked (which happens later through regular function
//! elaboration).
//!
//! ## Impl Collection Pipeline
//!
//! The impl collection process occurs in several phases:
//!
//! 1. Function metadata definition
//!    - Resolves the impl's self type (e.g., `impl Foo` â†’ resolves `Foo` to a concrete type)
//!    - Collects function signatures for all methods in the impl block
//!    - This happens early so method signatures are available before bodies are elaborated
//!
//! 2. Method declaration
//!    - Declares methods in the struct's module (not the impl's module)
//!    - Handles method shadowing (inherent impls take precedence over trait impls)
//!    - Validates that impls are only defined for types in the current crate
//!    - This phase makes methods discoverable via `TypeName::method` syntax
//!
//! 3. Method elaboration
//!    - Elaborates method bodies using regular function elaboration
//!    - Type-checks method implementations
//!    - This is straightforward since methods are just functions with an implicit self parameter
//!
//! ## Cross Module Resolution Strategy
//!
//! Impl methods can be declared in one module but resolved in another.
//!
//! - Declaration module: The struct's defining module (where the type was defined)
//!   - Methods are added here so `TypeName::method` resolves correctly
//!   - This allows qualified method calls from anywhere with the right imports
//! - Resolution module: The impl block's module (where the impl appears)
//!   - Names inside method bodies resolve in this scope
//!   - This determines what imports, types, and functions are visible to the method
//!
//! ### Example:
//! ```noir
//! // In module `types`:
//! struct Point { x: Field, y: Field }
//!
//! // In module `methods`:
//! use crate::types::Point;
//! impl Point {
//!     fn distance(self) -> Field {
//!         // This resolves names in `methods` module
//!         helper_function() // looks for helper_function in `methods`
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! - `distance` is declared in the `types` module (with `Point`)
//! - `distance` body resolves names in the `methods` module
//! - Users can call `Point::distance` if they import `Point`
//!
//! ## Method Shadowing and Specialization
//!
//! When multiple methods with the same name are declared:
//!
//! 1. Inherent impls shadow trait impls: If both an inherent impl and a trait impl
//!    define the same method, the inherent impl version takes precedence for qualified
//!    calls like `Foo::method()`. The trait impl version is removed from the module scope
//!    to prevent ambiguity.
//! 2. Specialization: Multiple trait impls can define the same method if their
//!    self types don't overlap. The method is removed from module scope when a duplicate
//!    is found, preventing qualified access. However, the methods are still registered
//!    in the interner for dynamic dispatch. Overlap checking happens later during
//!    trait resolution.
//!
//! ## Restrictions
//!
//! - Foreign impl check: Inherent impls are only allowed on types defined in the
//!   current crate. This prevents external crates from adding methods to your types.
//! - Primitive type impls: Only the standard library can impl methods on primitive
//!   types like `Field`, `bool`, `u32`, etc. User code cannot add methods to primitives.
