//! The goal of the mem2reg SSA optimization pass is to replace any `Load` instructions to known
//! addresses with the value stored at that address, if it is also known. This pass will also remove
//! any `Store` instructions within a block that are no longer needed because no more loads occur in
//! between the Store in question and the next Store.
//!
//! ## How the pass works:
//! - Each block in each function is iterated in forward-order.
//! - The starting value of each reference in the block is the unification of the same references
//!   at the end of each direct predecessor block to the current block.
//! - At each step, the value of each reference is either known or unknown, tracked with a map.
//! - Two reference values unify to each other if they are exactly equal.
//! - If a block has no predecessors, the starting value of each reference is unknown (not present in the map).
//! - Throughout this pass, aliases of each reference are also tracked.
//!   - References typically have 1 alias - themselves.
//!   - A reference with multiple aliases means we will not be able to optimize out loads if the
//!     reference is stored to. Note that this means we can still optimize out loads if these
//!     aliased references are never stored to, or the store occurs after a load.
//!   - A reference with 0 aliases means we were unable to find which reference this reference
//!     refers to. If such a reference is stored to, we must conservatively invalidate every
//!     reference in the current block.
//! - We also track the last load instruction to each address per block.
//!
//! From there, to figure out the value of each reference at the end of block, iterate each instruction:
//! - On `Instruction::Allocate`:
//!   - Register a new reference was made with itself as its only alias
//! - On `Instruction::Load { address }`:
//!   - If `address` is known to only have a single alias (including itself) and if the value of
//!     that alias is known, replace the value of the load with the known value.
//!   - Furthermore, if the result of the load is a reference, mark the result as an alias
//!     of the reference it dereferences to (if known).
//!     - If which reference it dereferences to is not known, this load result has no aliases.
//!   - We also track the last instance of a load instruction to each address in a block.
//!     If we see that the last load instruction was from the same address as the current load instruction,
//!     we move to replace the result of the current load with the result of the previous load.
//!
//!     This removal requires a couple conditions:
//!       - No store occurs to that address before the next load,
//!       - The address is not used as an argument to a call
//!
//!     This optimization helps us remove repeated loads for which there are not known values.
//! - On `Instruction::Store { address, value }`:
//!   - If the address of the store is known:
//!     - If the address has exactly 1 alias:
//!       - Set the value of the address to the known `value`.
//!     - If the address has more than 1 alias:
//!       - Clear out the known value of of every possible alias.
//!     - If the address has 0 aliases:
//!       - Conservatively mark every alias in the block as unknown.
//!   - If the address of the store is not known:
//!     - Conservatively mark every alias in the block as unknown.
//!   - Additionally, if there were no Loads to any alias of the address between this Store and
//!     the previous Store to the same address, the previous store can be removed.
//!   - Remove the instance of the last load instruction to the address and its aliases
//! - On `Instruction::Call { arguments }`:
//!   - If any argument of the call is a reference, remove the known value of each alias of that
//!     reference
//!   - Any builtin functions that may return aliases if their input also contains a
//!     reference should be tracked. Examples: `slice_push_back`, `slice_insert`, `slice_remove`, etc.
//!   - Remove the instance of the last load instruction for any reference arguments and their aliases
//!
//! On a terminator instruction:
//! - If the terminator is a `Jmp`:
//!   - For each reference argument of the jmp, mark the corresponding block parameter it is passed
//!     to as an alias for the jmp argument.
//!
//! Finally, if this is the only block in the function, we can remove any Stores that were not
//! referenced by the terminator instruction.
//!
//! Repeating this algorithm for each block in the function in program order should result in
//! optimizing out most known loads. However, identifying all aliases correctly has been proven
//! undecidable in general (Landi, 1992). So this pass will not always optimize out all loads
//! that could theoretically be optimized out. This pass can be performed at any time in the
//! SSA optimization pipeline, although it will be more successful the simpler the program's CFG is.
//! This pass is currently performed several times to enable other passes - most notably being
//! performed before loop unrolling to try to allow for mutable variables used for loop indices.
