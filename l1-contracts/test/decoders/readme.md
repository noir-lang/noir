# Decoder test

To generate test data (also used in rollup test), run the `integration_l1_publisher.test.ts` in end-to-end, it will generate the test data in the fixtures folder.

It is generally set to NOT overwrite the existing data. But you can change the `AZTEC_GENERATE_TEST_DATA` to true before running the test.
