name: Test (MSRV check)

# TL;DR https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/issues/4384
#
# This workflow acts to ensure that we can publish to crates.io, we need this extra check as libraries don't respect the Cargo.lock file committed in this repository.
# We must then always be able to build the workspace using the latest versions of all of our dependencies, so we explicitly update them and build in this workflow.

  schedule:
    # Run a nightly check at 2 AM UTC
