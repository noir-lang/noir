name: Test (ARM64)

# This workflow runs the project Rust tests on a daily basis on ARM64.
# The main intention of doing this is making sure that build artifacts end up exactly
# the same as in X86, but this workflow runs all tests to also make sure everything
# works the same way on ARM64. Because of this, most of the code here is similar
# to that in test-rust-workspace.yml
