## Asking Questions

The best place to ask general questions about Noir is in the #noir channel on the [Aztec discord](https://discord.gg/aztec).

It might also be helpful to review existing and previous Github issues to see if your question has been answered already.

For specific technical questions, submitting an issue in this repo may be the best place to ask.

## Giving Feedback

Feedback is a gift. The #noir channel on Discord is a great synchronous channel for feedback. Reporting issues that you encounter is also a great channel for sharing feedback.

## Submitting Issues

Submitting an issue in this repository is a great way to contribute and get help with problems that you run into.
When submitting an issue, please include as much detail as possible about the error message, your environment (OS, version numbers, etc) and the steps to reproduce the error.

## Contributing to the Standard Library

Noir is still very new and there are many cryptographic primitives that we have yet to build that will be useful for the community. If you have other ideas, please reach out on the [Aztec Discord](https://discord.gg/aztec) to discuss. You can find the current list of requested primitives in the [issues section](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/labels/noir-stdlib) marked with the label `noir-stdlib`.

## Funding Opportunities

Aztec is offering grants to people and teams that want to use, test or build Noir. You can find more information about the grants program [here](https://aztec.network/grants).

## Full-time Contributors

Aztec is hiring a wide variety of software engineers, so if you would like to work on Noir full-time consider applying for an [open role](https://aztec.network/careers).
