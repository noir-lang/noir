# AST Fuzzer

The AST Fuzzer generates arbitrary _monomorphized_ AST `Program` instances and
executes them with various compilation strategies. For example we can:

* compare the execution of and AST with minimal SSA passes versus the normal SSA flow, to test that all SSA transformations preserve behavior
* perform random mutations on the AST that should preserve behavior, and check that the execution result with the full SSA flow is the same
* compare ACIR and Brillig executions of the same AST

The following command can be used to print some random AST to the console:

```shell
cargo run -p noir_ast_fuzzer --example sample
```

To run the fuzzer, pick one of the available targets:

```console
$ cd tooling/ast_fuzzer
$ cargo fuzz list
acir_vs_brillig
init_vs_final
orig_vs_mutant
```

and execute it with some time or execution limits:

```shell
cargo +nightly fuzz run acir_vs_brillig -- -runs=1000 -max_total_time=60 -max_len=1048576
```

If there is an error, `cargo fuzz` will capture the artifacts required for a repeated run under the `artifacts` directory, and will print the command to run it again, which can be done with something like this:

```shell
cargo +nightly fuzz run -O acir_vs_brillig fuzz/artifacts/acir_vs_brillig/crash-9270e36f612ed9022ede3496c97c24cebb6e2301
```

Note that `cargo fuzz` requires `nightly` build, which can be either turned on with the `cargo +nightly` flag, or by running `rustup default nightly`. Also note that `cargo fuzz run` automatically creates a `--release` build, there is no need for an explicit flag to be passed.

The `NOIR_AST_FUZZER_SHOW_AST` env var can be used to print the AST before compilation, in case the compiler crashes on the generated program. Otherwise if the execution fails, the output will include the AST, the inputs, and the ACIR/Brillig opcodes.
