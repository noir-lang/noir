# AST Fuzzer

The AST Fuzzer generates arbitrary _monomorphized_ AST `Program` instances and
executes them with various compilation strategies. For example we can:

* compare the execution of and AST with minimal SSA passes versus the normal SSA flow, to test that all SSA transformations preserve behavior
* perform metamorphic transformations on the AST that should preserve behavior, and check that the execution result with the full SSA flow is the same
* compare ACIR and Brillig executions of the same AST

The following command can be used to print some random AST to the console:

```shell
cargo run -p noir_ast_fuzzer --example sample
```

To run the fuzzer, pick one of the available targets:

```console
$ cd tooling/ast_fuzzer
$ cargo fuzz list
acir_vs_brillig
comptime_vs_brillig
min_vs_full
orig_vs_morph
```

and execute it with some time or execution limits:

```shell
cargo +nightly fuzz run acir_vs_brillig -- -runs=1000 -max_total_time=60 -max_len=1048576
```

If there is an error, `cargo fuzz` will capture the artifacts required for a repeated run under the `artifacts` directory, and will print the command to run it again, which can be done with something like this:

```shell
cargo +nightly fuzz run acir_vs_brillig fuzz/artifacts/acir_vs_brillig/crash-9270e36f612ed9022ede3496c97c24cebb6e2301
```

Note that `cargo fuzz` requires `nightly` build, which can be either turned on with the `cargo +nightly` flag, or by running `rustup default nightly`. Also note that `cargo fuzz run` automatically creates a `--release` build, there is no need for an explicit flag to be passed.

The `NOIR_AST_FUZZER_SHOW_AST` env var can be used to print the AST before compilation, in case the compiler crashes on the generated program. Otherwise if the execution fails, the output will include the AST, the inputs, and the ACIR/Brillig opcodes.

## `arbtest`

To get quick feedback about whether there are any easy-to-discover bugs, we can run the following test:

```shell
cargo test -p noir_ast_fuzzer_fuzz arbtest
```

Unlike `cargo fuzz`, these don't "ramp up" the complexity of the code, but go full tilt from the beginning, and only run for a limited amount of time (e.g. 10 seconds). Upon failure they print a hexadecimal `seed`, which can be used with the `NOIR_ARBTEST_SEED` env var to replicate the error.

## Minimizing Noir

At the moment test failures end up with one or two Noir-like AST printed on the console, with the corresponding ABI formatted inputs.
We can turn these into `nargo` projects to replicate the problem that causes the error.

Especially with the `arbtest` mentioned above, the Noir AST can be big, certainly much larger than what we would want to put in a bug ticket. If that is the case, we can try minimizing the example with the [Noir Minimizer](./minimizer/README.md) tool.
