# Noir Minimizer

The minimizer is an experimental tool with the primary goal to help reduce the size of Noir examples found
by the AST fuzzer that fail due to some reason, and require minimization before a bug ticket can be opened.

It relies on [cvise](https://github.com/marxin/cvise?tab=readme-ov-file) to try and make the Noir program
smaller, while preserving some error message we receive from `nargo`.

The tool requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) being installed on the developer machine.

## Usage

### Build a Docker image

`cvise` has binaries published for Linux; in the interest of being cross platform, we build a Docker image
that contains `cvise` and `nargo`, which it repeatedly invokes to compile the Noir code.

Execute the following command to build the image. This needs to be done every time `nargo` itself changes:

```shell
tooling/ast_fuzzer/minimizer/scripts/docker-build.sh
```

### Minimize Noir

To minimize a Noir project, it has to be in a single `main.nr` file, with a corresponding `Prover.toml` file,
and we need a single line of the error message we are looking to preserve from its original output.

With that, we need to invoke the `minimize.sh` script as follows:

```shell
tooling/ast_fuzzer/minimizer/scripts/minimize.sh "<error-message>" execute path/to/main.nr
```

The command can be `compile` or `execute`. The latter needs a `Prover.toml` file, which can be given following
the path to `main.nr`, or it is assumed to be in the parent directory of `main.nr`, like a regular Noir project.

The script makes a `main.nr.bkp` backup file, because the tool will minimize the Noir code in-place.

## Examples

> Note that the errors in this examples hopefully will have been fixed. They are here for illustration only.

### Assertion failure in `execute`

Say we have this code, which found by the fuzzer for https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/issues/8803

When we try to execute, we get this error:

```console
❯ cargo run -q -p nargo_cli -- execute --silence-warnings

error: Assertion failed: 'Bit size for rhs 254 does not match op bit size 1'
   ┌─ src/main.nr:22:16

   │
   = Call stack:
     1. src/main.nr:5:8
     2. src/main.nr:22:16

Failed assertion
```

That's pretty clear, but the code is a bit large. See if we can reduce it.

First try with a related, but different error message, just to see what happens:

```console
❯ tooling/ast_fuzzer/minimizer/scripts/scripts/minimize.sh "condition value is not a boolean: MismatchedBitSize" execute test_programs/execution_success/fuzz_testing/src/main.nr
C-Vise cannot run because the interestingness test does not return
zero. Please ensure that it does so not only in the directory where
you are invoking C-Vise, but also in an arbitrary temporary
directory containing only the files that are being reduced. In other
words, running these commands:

  DIR=`mktemp -d`
  cp /noir/main.nr $DIR
  cd $DIR
  /noir/check.sh
  echo $?

should result in '0' being echoed to the terminal.
Please ensure that the test script takes no arguments; it should be hard-coded to refer
to the same file that is passed as an argument to C-Vise.
```

So `cvise` is telling us that the script the tool prepared did not return 0, which is because it looked for an error message that did not appear in the output.

Try again, with the correct message:

```console
❯ tooling/ast_fuzzer/minimizer/scripts/minimize.sh "Bit size for rhs 254 does not match op bit size 1" execute test_programs/execution_success/fuzz_testing/src/main.nr

```

We can observe the changes it makes by keeping `main.nr` open in our editor. After about a minute the file stops changing, and we can stop the tool with `Ctrl+C`.

The end result is much smaller:

It consists of 4 functions. Trying to compile it crashed the compiler:

```console
❯ cargo run -q -p nargo_cli -- compile
The application panicked (crashed).
Message:  Cannot return references from an if expression
Location: compiler/noirc_evaluator/src/ssa/opt/flatten_cfg/value_merger.rs:68
```

See if we can minimize it:

```console
❯ tooling/ast_fuzzer/minimizer/scripts/minimize.sh "Cannot return references from an if expression" execute $PWD/test_programs/execution_success/fuzz_testing/src/main.nr

Reduced test-cases:

--- /noir/main.nr ---
fn main(b : (bool, bool, str<3>, bool))->return_data bool {
  let mut e = &mut false;
  e = { if b .3 {e = &mut false} e };
  b .0
}
```

That's pretty much spot on, almost the same as the one in the ticket!
