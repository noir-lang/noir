# Mutable References to Closures and Functions Test

This test case addresses [GitHub issue #8478](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/issues/8478), which requested more tests for storing closures or functions in mutable references.

## Test Content

The test includes multiple scenarios:

1. **Basic Function References**: Tests passing functions as parameters and storing them in variables
2. **Mutable Function References**: Tests updating function references through mutable references
3. **Closure References**: Tests storing closures that capture variables in mutable references
4. **Nested Closures**: Tests complex scenarios with closures that create other closures
5. **Control Flow**: Tests conditional logic that affects which functions are stored

## Functionality Tested

- Storing functions in mutable variables
- Passing functions as parameters
- Updating function references through mutable references
- Working with closures that capture variables
- Creating closures that return other closures
- Using control flow to determine which function/closure to store

This test ensures that Noir properly handles mutable references to functions and closures, which is an important aspect of the language's reference system.
