The field type corresponds to the native field type of the proving backend.

The size of a Noir field depends on the elliptic curve's finite field for the proving backend
adopted. For example, a field would be a 254-bit integer when paired with the default backend that
spans the Grumpkin curve.

Fields support integer arithmetic and are often used as the default numeric type in Noir:

```rust
fn main(x : Field, y : Field)  {
    let z = x + y;
}
```

`x`, `y` and `z` are all private fields in this example. Using the `let` keyword we defined a new
private value `z` constrained to be equal to `x + y`.

If proving efficiency is of priority, fields should be used as a default for solving problems.
Smaller integer types (e.g. `u64`) incur extra range constraints.

## Methods

After declaring a Field, you can use these common methods on it:

### to_le_bits

Transforms the field into an array of bits, Little Endian.

```rust
fn to_le_bits<N>(_x : Field, _bit_size: u32) -> [u1; N]
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2;
    let bits = field.to_le_bits(32);
}
```

### to_be_bits

Transforms the field into an array of bits, Big Endian.

```rust
fn to_be_bits<N>(_x : Field, _bit_size: u32) -> [u1; N]
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2;
    let bits = field.to_be_bits(32);
}
```

### to_le_bytes

Transforms into an array of bytes, Little Endian

```rust
fn to_le_bytes(_x : Field, byte_size: u32) -> [u8]
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2;
    let bytes = field.to_le_bytes(4);
}
```

### to_be_bytes

Transforms into an array of bytes, Big Endian

```rust
fn to_be_bytes(_x : Field, byte_size: u32) -> [u8]
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2;
    let bytes = field.to_be_bytes(4);
}
```

### to_le_radix

Decomposes into a vector over the specified base, Little Endian

```rust
fn to_le_radix(_x : Field, _radix: u32, _result_len: u32) -> [u8]
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2;
    let radix = field.to_le_radix(256, 4);
}
```

### to_be_radix

Decomposes into a vector over the specified base, Big Endian

```rust
fn to_be_radix(_x : Field, _radix: u32, _result_len: u32) -> [u8]
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2;
    let radix = field.to_be_radix(256, 4);
}
```

### pow_32

Returns the value to the power of the specified exponent

```rust
fn pow_32(self, exponent: Field) -> Field
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2
    let pow = field.pow_32(4);
    assert(pow == 16);
}
```

### assert_max_bit_size

Adds a constraint to specify that the field can be represented with `bit_size` number of bits

```rust
fn assert_max_bit_size(self, bit_size: u32)
```

example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let field = 2
    field.assert_max_bit_size(32);
}
```

### sgn0

Parity of (prime) Field element, i.e. sgn0(x mod p) = 0 if x âˆˆ \{0, ..., p-1\} is even, otherwise sgn0(x mod p) = 1.

```rust
fn sgn0(self) -> u1
```


### lt

Returns true if the field is less than the other field

```rust
pub fn lt(self, another: Field) -> bool
```
