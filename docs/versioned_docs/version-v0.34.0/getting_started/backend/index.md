Proving backends each provide their own tools for working with Noir programs, providing functionality like proof generation, proof verification, and verifier smart contract generation.

For the latest information on tooling provided by each proving backend, installation instructions, Noir version compatibility... you may refer to the proving backends' own documentation.

You can find the full list of proving backends compatible with Noir in [Awesome Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/awesome-noir/?tab=readme-ov-file#proving-backends).

## Example: Installing `bb`

`bb` is the CLI tool provided by the [Barretenberg proving backend](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg) developed by Aztec Labs.

You can find the instructions for installation in [`bb`'s documentation](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/barretenberg/cpp/src/barretenberg/bb/readme.md#installation).

Once installed, we are ready to start working on [our first Noir program](../hello_noir/index.md).
