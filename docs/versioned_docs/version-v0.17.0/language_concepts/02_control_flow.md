## Loops

Noir has one kind of loop: the `for` loop. `for` loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple
times.

The following block of code between the braces is run 10 times.

```rust
for i in 0..10 {
    // do something
};
```

The index for loops is of type `u64`.

## If Expressions

Noir supports `if-else` statements. The syntax is most similar to Rust's where it is not required
for the statement's conditional to be surrounded by parentheses.

```rust
let a = 0;
let mut x: u32 = 0;

if a == 0 {
    if a != 0 {
        x = 6;
    } else {
        x = 2;
    }
} else {
    x = 5;
    assert(x == 5);
}
assert(x == 2);
```
