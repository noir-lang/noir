## scalar_mul::fixed_base

Performs scalar multiplication over the embedded curve whose coordinates are defined by the
configured noir field. For the BN254 scalar field, this is BabyJubJub or Grumpkin.

```rust
fn fixed_base(_input : Field) -> [Field; 2]
```

example

```rust
fn main(x : Field) {
    let scal = std::scalar_mul::fixed_base(x);
    std::println(scal);
}
```
