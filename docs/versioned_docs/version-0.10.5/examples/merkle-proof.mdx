Let's walk through an example of a merkle membership proof in Noir that proves that a given leaf is
in a merkle tree.

```rust
use dep::std;

fn main(message : [Field; 62], index : Field, hashpath : [Field; 40], root : Field) {
    let leaf = std::hash::hash_to_field(message);
    let merkle_root = std::merkle::compute_merkle_root(leaf, index, hashpath);
    assert(merkle_root == root);
}

```

The message is hashed using `hash_to_field`. The specific hash function that is being used is chosen
by the backend. The only requirement is that this hash function can heuristically be used as a
random oracle. If only collision resistance is needed, then one can call `std::hash::pedersen`
instead.

```rust
let leaf = std::hash::hash_to_field(message);
```

The leaf is then passed to a compute_merkle_root function with the root, index and hashpath. The returned root can then be asserted to be the same as the provided root.

```rust
let merkle_root = std::merkle::compute_merkle_root(leaf, index, hashpath);
assert (merkle_root == root);
```

An example, the merkle membership proof, only requires a hash function that has collision
resistance, hence a hash function like Pedersen is allowed, which in most cases is more efficient
than the even more conservative sha256.
