<Experimental />

Noir has support for Oracles via RPC calls. This means Noir will make an RPC call and use the return value for proof generation.

Since Oracles are not resolved by Noir, they are [`unconstrained` functions](./unconstrained.md)

You can declare an Oracle through the `#[oracle(<name>)]` flag. Example:

```rust
#[oracle(get_number_sequence)]
unconstrained fn get_number_sequence(_size: Field) -> [Field] {}
```

The timeout for when using an external RPC oracle resolver can be set with the `NARGO_FOREIGN_CALL_TIMEOUT` environment variable. This timeout is in units of milliseconds.
