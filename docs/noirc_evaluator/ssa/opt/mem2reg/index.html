addresses with the value stored at that address, if it is also known. This pass will also remove
any <code>Store</code> instructions within a block that are no longer needed because no more loads occur in
between the Store in question and the next Store.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-pass-works"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#how-the-pass-works">§</a>How the pass works:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each block in each function is iterated in forward-order.</li>
<li>The starting value of each reference in the block is the unification of the same references
at the end of each direct predecessor block to the current block.</li>
<li>At each step, the value of each reference is either known or unknown, tracked with a map.</li>
<li>Two reference values unify to each other if they are exactly equal.</li>
<li>If a block has no predecessors, the starting value of each reference is unknown (not present in the map).</li>
<li>Throughout this pass, aliases of each reference are also tracked.
<ul>
<li>References typically have 1 alias - themselves.</li>
<li>A reference with multiple aliases means we will not be able to optimize out loads if the
reference is stored to. Note that this means we can still optimize out loads if these
aliased references are never stored to, or the store occurs after a load.</li>
<li>A reference with 0 aliases means we were unable to find which reference this reference
refers to. If such a reference is stored to, we must conservatively invalidate every
reference in the current block.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We also track the last load instruction to each address per block.</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, to figure out the value of each reference at the end of block, iterate each instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li>On <code>Instruction::Allocate</code>:
<ul>
<li>Register a new reference was made with itself as its only alias</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On <code>Instruction::Load { address }</code>:
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <code>address</code> is known to only have a single alias (including itself) and if the value of
that alias is known, replace the value of the load with the known value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, if the result of the load is a reference, mark the result as an alias
of the reference it dereferences to (if known).</p>
<ul>
<li>If which reference it dereferences to is not known, this load result has no aliases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also track the last instance of a load instruction to each address in a block.
If we see that the last load instruction was from the same address as the current load instruction,
we move to replace the result of the current load with the result of the previous load.</p>
<p>This removal requires a couple conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No store occurs to that address before the next load,</li>
<li>The address is not used as an argument to a call</li>
</ul>
<p>This optimization helps us remove repeated loads for which there are not known values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On <code>Instruction::Store { address, value }</code>:
<ul>
<li>If the address of the store is known:
<ul>
<li>If the address has exactly 1 alias:
<ul>
<li>Set the value of the address to the known <code>value</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the address has more than 1 alias:
<ul>
<li>Clear out the known value of of every possible alias.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the address has 0 aliases:
<ul>
<li>Conservatively mark every alias in the block as unknown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the address of the store is not known:
<ul>
<li>Conservatively mark every alias in the block as unknown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally, if there were no Loads to any alias of the address between this Store and
the previous Store to the same address, the previous store can be removed.</li>
<li>Remove the instance of the last load instruction to the address and its aliases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On <code>Instruction::Call { arguments }</code>:
<ul>
<li>If any argument of the call is a reference, remove the known value of each alias of that
reference</li>
<li>Any builtin functions that may return aliases if their input also contains a
reference should be tracked. Examples: <code>slice_push_back</code>, <code>slice_insert</code>, <code>slice_remove</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Remove the instance of the last load instruction for any reference arguments and their aliases</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a terminator instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the terminator is a <code>Jmp</code>:
<ul>
<li>For each reference argument of the jmp, mark the corresponding block parameter it is passed
to as an alias for the jmp argument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if this is the only block in the function, we can remove any Stores that were not
referenced by the terminator instruction.</p>
<p>Repeating this algorithm for each block in the function in program order should result in
optimizing out most known loads. However, identifying all aliases correctly has been proven
undecidable in general (Landi, 1992). So this pass will not always optimize out all loads
that could theoretically be optimized out. This pass can be performed at any time in the
SSA optimization pipeline, although it will be more successful the simpler the program’s CFG is.
This pass is currently performed several times to enable other passes - most notably being
performed before loop unrolling to try to allow for mutable variables used for loop indices.</p>
