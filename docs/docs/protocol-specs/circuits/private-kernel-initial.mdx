# Private Kernel Circuit - Initial

<!--
Mike review:
Missing Gas Measurement?
For consistency with other sections, please can we wrap all struct data members and definitions in `backticks` (rather than in _italics_)?
It would be difficult, but it would be nice to have the following diagrams:
- A class diagram (written in mermaid), showing the relationships between all classes. Lasse did a good example in the `../rollup-circuits/` section. It's a nice big diagram where you can see everything.
- A diagram (possibly in something easier-to-use than mermaid, such as excalidraw/miro/diagrams.net) showing how data is moved around by the kernel circuit, and a visualisation of all the below-written checks that are performed.
Edit: I had a go at a diagram. It's "ok". Took a while.
-->

## Requirements

In the **initial** kernel iteration, the process involves taking a [`transaction_request`](#transactionrequest) and private call data <!-- n/d. By "private call data" do we mean the public inputs of a private function circuit? We should link to the subsection with the exact definition, please. -->, performing checks on this data (see below), and preparing the necessary data for subsequent circuits to operate. This "initial" circuit is an optimization over the [inner private kernel circuit](./private-kernel-inner.mdx), as there is no "previous kernel" to verify at the beginning of a transaction. Additionally, this circuit executes tasks that need only occur once per transaction.

### Key Checks within this Circuit

#### This first function call of the transaction must match the caller's intent

The following data in the [`private_inputs`](#private-inputs).[`private_call`](#privatecall) must match the corresponding fields of the user's [`private_inputs`](#private-inputs).[`transaction_request`](#transactionrequest):

- `contract_address`
- `function_data`
- `args_hash`: Hash of the function arguments.

> Notice: a `transaction_request` doesn't explicitly contain a signature. Aztec implements [account abstraction](../addresses-and-keys/keys-requirements.md#authorization-keys), so the process for authorizing a transaction (if at all) is dictated by the logic of the functions of that transaction. In particular, an account contract can be called as an 'entrypoint' to a transaction, and there, custom authorization logic can be executed.

#### It must be a standard [synchronous function call](../calls/sync-calls.md)

<!-- Do we have a field which counts how many functions have been executed so far? I think there used to be one. Is it not needed anymore? The previous title "Ensuring the function call is the first call" of this subsection made me think about this. -->

For the [`private_inputs`](#private-inputs)[`.private_call`](#privatecall)[`.call_stack_item`](#privatecallstackitem)[`.public_inputs`](./private-function.md#public-inputs)[`.call_context: CallContext`](./private-function.md#callcontext), the circuit checks that:

- It must not be a delegate call:
  - `call_context.is_delegate_call == false`
- It must not be a static call:
  - `call_context.is_static_call == false`

<!-- Do we need checks for the other call types (see the ../calls/* section)? -->

#### The `transaction_request` must be unique

<!-- TODO: link to a section describing nonce abstraction -->

It must emit the hash of the [`private_inputs.transaction_request`](#transactionrequest) as the **first** nullifier. <!-- TODO: consider Palla's suggestion to implement "tx hash abstraction", where it's up to account contracts to compute the tx hash -->

<!-- TODO: more exact hashing and encoding definitions, eventually -->

The hash is computed as:

```js
let { origin, function_data, args_hash, tx_context } =
  private_inputs.transaction_request;
let tx_hash = hash(origin, function_data.hash(), args_hash, tx_context.hash());
```

Where `function_data.hash()` and `tx_context.hash()` are the hashes of the serialized field elements.

This nullifier serves multiple purposes:

- Identifying a transaction.
- Non-malleability. Preventing the signature of a transaction request from being reused in another transaction.
- Generating values that should be maintained within the transaction's scope. For example, it is utilized to [compute the note nonces](./private-kernel-tail.md#siloing-values) for all the note hashes in a transaction.

> Note that the final transaction data is not deterministic for a given transaction request. The production of new notes, the destruction of notes, and various other values are likely to change based on the time and conditions when a transaction is being composed. However, the intricacies of implementation should not be a concern for the entity initiating the transaction.

### Processing a Private Function Call

#### The function being called must exist within the contract class of the called `contract_address`

<!--
TODO: ensure the function leaf preimage matches vs the way it's described in the contract-deployment section.
TODO: a process to ensure these definitions always align with the definitions in the contract-deployment section.
-->

With the following data provided from [`private_inputs`](#private-inputs)[`.private_call`](#privatecall):

- `contract_address` in `private_call`[`.call_stack_item`](#privatecallstackitem).
- `contract_instance`
- `contract_class`
- `function_data` in `private_call`[`.call_stack_item`](#privatecallstackitem).

This circuit validates the existence of the function in the contract through the following checks:

<!-- I'd maybe reverse the order that these checks are explained. I.e. ordering it as: the function's data exists within the function tree, within the class_id, within the contract instance, within the address -->

1. Verify that the `contract_address` can be derived from the `contract_instance`:

   Refer to the details [here](../contract-deployment/instances.md#address) for the process of computing the address for a contract instance.

2. Verify that the `contract_instance.contract_class_id` can be derived from the given `contract_class`:

   Refer to the details [here](../contract-deployment/classes.md#class-identifier) for the process of computing the _contract_class_id_.

3. Verify that _contract_class_data.private_functions_ includes the function being called:

   1. Compute the hash of the verification key:
      - `vk_hash = hash(private_call.vk)`
   2. Compute the function leaf:
      - `hash(function_data.selector, vk_hash, private_call.bytecode_hash)` <!-- Q: should this include the rest of the function_data too? -->
   3. Perform a membership check; that the function leaf exists within the function tree, where:
      - The index and sibling path are provided through [`private_call`](#privatecall)`.function_leaf_membership_witness`.
      - The root is `contract_class.private_functions`. <!-- TODO: consider renaming this to make it clearer that it's the root of a function tree -->

#### The private function proof must verify

It verifies that the private function was executed successfully with the provided proof data, verification key, and the public inputs of the [private function circuit](./private-function.md).
I.e. `private_inputs.private_call.vk`, `private_inputs.private_call.proof`, and `private_inputs.private_call.call_stack_item.public_inputs`.

#### Validate the counters.

In ensuring the integrity of emitted data, counters play a crucial role in establishing the chronological order of elements generated during a transaction. This validation process not only guards against misinterpretations but also reinforces trust in the sequence of transactions.

Counters are employed to validate the following aspects:

1. **Read Requests**: Verify that a read request is reading a value created before the request is submitted.
   - Refer to [Read Request Reset Private Kernel Circuit](./private-kernel-reset.md#read-request-reset-private-kernel-circuit) for verification details.
2. **Ordered Emission**: Ensure that side effects (note hashes, nullifiers, logs) are emitted in the same order as they were created.
   - Refer to [Tail Private Kernel Circuit](./private-kernel-tail.md#verifying-and-splitting-ordered-data) for order enforcement.

For these operations to be effective, specific requirements for the counters must be met:

- Each counter for values of the same type must be unique, avoiding confusion about the order.
- Values emitted within a function call must not be mistaken for values emitted from another function call.

The circuit undergoes the following validations for data within [`private_inputs`](#privateinputs).[`private_call`](#privatecall).[public_inputs](./private-function.md#public-inputs):

1.  Validate the counter range of [`call_stack_item`](#privatecallstackitem).

    - The `counter_start` must be `0`.
      - This check can be skipped for [inner private kernel circuit](./private-kernel-inner.mdx#verifying-the-counters).
    - The `counter_end` must be strictly greater than the `counter_start`.

    The counter range (`counter_start` to `counter_end`) is later used to restrict counters emitted within the call.

2.  Validate the counter ranges of non-empty requests in `private_call_requests`.

    - The `counter_end` of each request must be strictly greater than its `counter_start`.
    - The `counter_start` of the first request must be strictly greater than the `counter_start` of the `call_stack_item`.
    - The `counter_start` of the second and each of the subsequent requests must be strictly greater than the `counter_end` of the previous request.
    - The `counter_end` of the last request must be strictly less than the `counter_end` of the `call_stack_item`.

    When a `request` is [popped](./private-kernel-inner.mdx#ensuring-the-current-call-matches-the-call-request) in a nested iteration, its counter range is checked against the `call_stack_item`, as described [here](./private-kernel-inner.mdx#verifying-the-counters). By enforcing that the counter ranges of all nested `private_call_requests` do not overlap with one another in this step, a function circuit will not be able to emit a value whose counter falls in the range of another call.

3.  Validate the counters of the non-empty elements in the following arrays:

    - `note_hashes`
    - `nullifiers`
    - `l2_to_l1_messages`
    - `unencrypted_log_hashes`
    - `encrypted_log_hashes`
    - `encrypted_note_preimage_hashes`
    - `note_hash_read_requests`
    - `nullifier_read_requests`
    - `public_call_requests`

    1. For each of the above "ordered" array, the counters of the non-empty elements must be in a strictly-increasing order:

       - The `counter` of the first element must be strictly greater than the `counter_start` of the `call_stack_item`.
       - The `counter` of each subsequent element must be strictly greater than the `counter` of the previous item.
       - The `counter` of the last element must be strictly less than the `counter_end` of the `call_stack_item`.

    2. Additionally, the counters must not fall within the counter range of any nested private call.

       Get the value `NE`, which is the number of non-empty requests in `private_call_requests`. If `NE` is greater than `0`, the circuit checks the following:

       For each `note_hash` at index `i` in `note_hashes`:

       - Find the `request_index` at [`hints`](#hints).`note_hash_range_hints[i]`, which is the index of the `private_call_requests` with the smallest `counter_start` that was emitted after the `note_hash`.
       - If `request_index` equals `NE`, indicating no request was emitted after the `note_hash`, its counter must be greater than the `counter_end` of the last request.
       - If `request_index` equals `0`, indicating no request was emitted before the `note_hash`. Its counter must be less than the `counter_start` of the first request.
       - Otherwise, the request was emitted after the `note_hash`, and its immediate previous request was emitted before the `note_hash`. Its counter must fall between those two requests.

       The code simplifies as:

       ```rust
       let NE = count_non_empty_elements(private_call_requests);
       for i in 0..note_hashes.len() {
          let note_hash = note_hashes[i];
          if !note_hash.is_empty() {
            let request_index = note_hash_range_hints[i];
            if request_index != NE {
              note_hash.counter < private_call_requests[request_index].counter_start;
            }
            if request_index != 0 {
              note_hash.counter > private_call_requests[request_index - 1].counter_end;
            }
          }
       }
       ```

       Repeat the above process for emitted data, including:

       - `nullifiers`
       - `unencrypted_log_hashes`
       - `encrypted_log_hashes`
       - `encrypted_note_preimage_hashes`

<!-- Leila: Do we need to perform the last check for requests? Do we even need to do it at all? -->
<!-- Do we need to validate that, across all of the counters, it is possible to count 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... , with no gaps? Or does the kernel not care about that, and entrusts the private function to enforce this monotonically-increasing counting? -->
<!-- Do we need to validate that there are no duplicate counters _across_ arrays. E.g. if an element of note_hashes has a counter=7 and an element of nullifiers also has a counter=7, is that a problem? -->

### Validating Public Inputs

#### Verifying the `TransientAccumulatedData`.

The various side effects of the [`private_inputs`](#private-inputs)[`.private_call`](#privatecall)[`.call_stack_item`](#privatecallstackitem)[`.public_inputs: PrivateFunctionPublicInputs`](./private-function.md#public-inputs) are formatted and pushed to the various arrays of the [`public_inputs`](#public-inputs)[`.transient_accumulated_data: TransientAccumulatedData`](#transientaccumulateddata).

This circuit verifies that the values in [`private_inputs`](#private-inputs)[`.private_call`](#privatecall)[`.call_stack_item`](#privatecallstackitem)[`.public_inputs: PrivateFunctionPublicInputs`](./private-function.md#public-inputs) are aggregated into the various arrays of the [`public_inputs`](#public-inputs)[`.transient_accumulated_data: TransientAccumulatedData`](#transientaccumulateddata) correctly.

1. Ensure that the specified values in the following arrays match those in the corresponding arrays in the `private_function_public_inputs`:

- `note_hash_contexts`
  - `value`, `counter`
- `nullifier_contexts`
  - `value`, `counter`
- `l2_to_l1_message_contexts`
  - `value`, `counter`
- `note_hash_read_requests`
  - `value`, `contract_address`, `counter`
- `nullifier_read_requests`
  - `value`, `contract_address`, `counter`
- `key_validation_request_contexts`
  - `parent_public_key`, `hardened_child_secret_key`
- `unencrypted_log_hash_contexts`
  - `hash`, `length`, `counter`
- `encrypted_log_hash_contexts`
  - `hash`, `length`, `randomness`, `counter`
- `encrypted_note_preimage_hash_contexts`
  - `hash`, `length`, `counter`, `note_hash_counter`
- `public_call_request_contexts`
  - `call_stack_item_hash`, `counter`

1. Check that the values in `private_call_request_stack` align with the values in `private_call_requests` within `private_function_public_inputs`, but in **reverse** order.

   > It's important that the `private_call_requests` are "pushed" to the `private_call_request_stack` in reverse order to ensure that they are executed in chronological order. <!-- What about the public function requests? Why don't we order those in reverse? -->

2. For each non-empty call request in both `private_call_request_stack` and `public_call_request_contexts` within `public_inputs.transient_accumulated_data`:

   - The `caller_contract_address` equals the [`private_call`](#privatecall)[`.call_stack_item`](#privatecallstackitem)[`.contract_address`].
   - The following values in `caller_context` are either empty or align with the values in the `private_inputs.private_call.call_stack_item.public_inputs.call_context`:
     - `(caller_context.msg_sender == 0) & (caller_context.storage_contract_address == 0)`
     - Or `(caller_context.msg_sender == call_context.msg_sender) & (caller_context.storage_contract_address == call_context.storage_contract_address)`
   - The `is_static_call` flag must be propagated:
     - `caller_context.is_static_call == call_context.is_static_call`

<!-- TODO: Consider amending this wording. The latest thinking is that msg_sender will always be revealed when doing a private->public call. An account contract can implement diversified addresses, if they wish to interact with public-land from a random-looking address -->

> The caller context in a call request may be empty for standard calls. This precaution is crucial to prevent information leakage, particularly as revealing the _msg_sender_ of this private function when calling a public function could pose security risks.

4. For each non-empty item in the following arrays, its `contract_address` must equal the `storage_contract_address` in `private_inputs.private_call.call_stack_item.public_inputs.call_context`:

   - `note_hash_contexts`
   - `nullifier_contexts`
   - `l2_to_l1_message_contexts`
   - `key_validation_request_contexts`
   - `unencrypted_log_hash_contexts`
   - `encrypted_log_hash_contexts`
   - `encrypted_note_preimage_hash_contexts`

   > Ensuring the alignment of the contract addresses is crucial, as it is later used to [silo the values](./private-kernel-tail.md#siloing-values) and to establish associations with values within the same contract.

5. For each non-empty item in `l2_to_l1_message_contexts`, its `portal_contract_address` must equal the `portal_contract_address` defined in `private_function_public_inputs.call_context`.
<!-- TODO: there's a proposal from Lasse to remove the 1:1 restriction on portals. It's still being discussed, though. -->

6. For each `note_hash_context: NoteHashContext` in the `note_hash_contexts`, validate its `nullifier_counter`. The value of the `nullifier_counter` can be:

   - Zero: if the note is not nullified in the same transaction.
   - Strictly greater than `note_hash.counter`: if the note is nullified in the same transaction.

   > Nullifier counters are used in the [reset private kernel circuit](./private-kernel-reset.md#read-request-reset-private-kernel-circuit) to ensure a read happens **before** a transient note is nullified.

   > Zero can be used to indicate a non-existing transient nullifier, as this value can never serve as the counter of a nullifier. It corresponds to the `counter_start` of the first function call.

> Note that the verification process outlined above is also applicable to the inner private kernel circuit. However, given that the `transient_accumulated_data` for the inner private kernel circuit comprises both values from previous iterations and the `private_call`, the above process specifically targets the values stemming from the `private_call`. The inner kernel circuit performs an [extra check](./private-kernel-inner.mdx#verifying-the-transient-accumulated-data) to ensure that the `transient_accumulated_data` also contains values from the previous iterations.

#### Verifying the constant data.

It verifies that:

- The `tx_context` in the [`constant_data`](#constantdata) matches the `tx_context` in the [`transaction_request`](#transactionrequest).
- The `block_header` must align with the one used in the private function circuit, as verified [earlier](#verifying-the-public-inputs-of-the-private-function-circuit).

#### Verifying the `min_revertible_side_effect_counter`.

It verifies that the `min_revertible_side_effect_counter` equals the value in the [`public_inputs`](./private-function.md#public-inputs) of the private function circuit.

## Types

### `FunctionData`

| Field               | Type                  | Description                            |

### `ContractClass`

<!-- TODO: ensure this aligns with the Contract Class section of this protocol specs -->
<!-- TODO:
Public functions and unconstrained functions won't be stored in a function tree; only private functions will be. Please liaise with Palla and David to align on how contract data will be deployed, and how AVM bytecode will be consumed.
-->

| Field                     | Type           | Description                                                        |

| `unconstrained_functions` | `field`        | Merkle root of the unconstrained function tree.                    |

### `TransactionContext`

| Field      | Type                                       | Description                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |

| `chain_id` | `field`                                    | Chain ID of the transaction. |
| `version`  | `field`                                    | Version of the transaction.  |

### `PrivateCallStackItem`

| Field              | Type                                                                 | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | `AztecAddress`                                                       | Address of the contract on which the function is invoked. |
| `function_data`    | [`FunctionData`](#functiondata)                                      | Data of the function being called.                        |
| `public_inputs`    | [`PrivateFunctionPublicInputs`](./private-function.md#public-inputs) | Public inputs of the private function circuit.            |

<!--
What's the mental model for when a PrivateCallStackItem should be used vs a CallRequest. They look very similar, and seem to contain very similar information.
Is the PrivateCallStackItem a struct representing function call (request) _that is created directly by a private function_? But the CallRequest is a struct representing a function call (request) _that is created by the kernel circuit as a modification of a PrivateCallStackItem_? Perhaps the names can be edited to describe the distinction?
 -->

### `PrivateCallRequestContext`

<!-- Q: Why is `caller_contract(_address)` needed if caller_context already contains msg_sender? Is it because delegatecalls can make the call_context data different from what you want here? -->

  contract_address: AztecAddress
}

etc.
