The Noir team is progressively adding new cryptographic primitives to the standard library. Reach out for news or if you would be interested in adding more of these calculations in Noir.

Some methods are available thanks to the Aztec backend, not being performed using Noir. When using other backends, these methods may or may not be supplied.
