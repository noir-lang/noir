A slice is a dynamically-sized view into a sequence of elements. They can be resized at runtime, but because they don't own the data, they cannot be returned from a circuit. You can treat slices as arrays without a constrained size.

```rust
use dep::std::slice;

fn main() -> pub Field {
    let mut slice: [Field] = [0; 2];

    let mut new_slice = slice.push_back(6);
    new_slice.len()
}
```

## Methods

For convenience, the STD provides some ready-to-use, common methods for slices:

### push_back

Pushes a new element to the end of the slice, returning a new slice with a length one greater than the original unmodified slice.

```rust
fn push_back<T>(_self: [T], _elem: T) -> [T]
```

example:

```rust
fn main() -> pub Field {
    let mut slice: [Field] = [0; 2];

    let mut new_slice = slice.push_back(6);
    new_slice.len()
}
```

### push_front

Returns a new array with the specified element inserted at index 0. The existing elements indexes are incremented by 1.

```rust
fn push_front(_self: Self, _elem: T) -> Self
```

Example:

```rust
let mut new_slice: [Field] = [];
new_slice = new_slice.push_front(20);
assert(new_slice[0] == 20); // returns true
```

### pop_front

Returns a tuple of two items, the first element of the array and the rest of the array.

```rust
fn pop_front(_self: Self) -> (T, Self)
```

Example:

```rust
let (first_elem, rest_of_slice) = slice.pop_front();
```

### pop_back

Returns a tuple of two items, the beginning of the array with the last element omitted and the last element.

```rust
fn pop_back(_self: Self) -> (Self, T)
```

Example:

```rust
let (popped_slice, last_elem) = slice.pop_back();
```

### append

Loops over a slice and adds it to the end of another.

```rust
fn append(mut self, other: Self) -> Self
```

Example:

```rust
let append = [1, 2].append([3, 4, 5]);
```

### insert

Inserts an element at a specified index and shifts all following elements by 1.

```rust
fn insert(_self: Self, _index: Field, _elem: T) -> Self
```

Example:

```rust
new_slice = rest_of_slice.insert(2, 100);
assert(new_slice[2] == 100);
```

### remove

Remove an element at a specified index, shifting all elements after it to the left, returning the altered slice and the removed element.

```rust
fn remove(_self: Self, _index: Field) -> (Self, T)
```

Example:

```rust
let (remove_slice, removed_elem) = slice.remove(3);
```
