The `bool` type in Noir has two possible values: `true` and `false`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;
    let f: bool = false;
}
```

The boolean type is most commonly used in conditionals like `if` expressions and `assert`
statements. More about conditionals is covered in the [Control Flow](../control_flow) and
[Assert Function](../assert) sections.
