title: Contract Communication
---

This section will walk over communication types that behaves differently than normal function calls.

Namely, if functions are in different domains, private vs. public, their execution behaves a little differently to what you might expect! See [Private <--> Public execution](./public_private_calls/main.md).

Likewise, executing a function on a different domain than its origin needs a bit extra thought. See [L1 <--> L2 communication](./cross_chain_calls.md).
