<!--

Hi there!

This is a TEMPLATE for a "HOW TO DO SOMETHING" guide.

-->

<!--

Here are some tips on writing style:

For CONSISTENCY between authors, YOU SHOULD use this layout and these headings.

The bulk of your explanations will go in the CUSTOM HEADING sections.



Be very direct, like a RECIPE book.

Not much prose. Prefer bullets, single sentences, copyable code snippets. Devs are lazy and don't want to read lots.

Deeper PROTOCOL discussion (under the hood explanations / justifying your protocol decisions) should go in the [protocol](../../protocol/) section. -->

<!-- Code snippets should be as minimal as possible. Get to the point. Remember, you can use #include_code syntax for code snippets (see the README.md) -->
