## Development

### Installation

This project requires recent versions of rust and cargo to be installed.
Any build errors should indicate dependencies that need installing, and at what version.

On the root folder of the repository, run:

```
yarn
yarn build
```

### Local Development

```
yarn workspace docs start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are
reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
yarn workspace docs build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static
contents hosting service. You can see a preview by running:

```
yarn workspace docs serve
```
