// Regular merkle tree means a append-only merkle tree (Explain why this is the only way to have privacy and alternatives if you don't want it)

// Returns one if the leaf is in the tree 
// and it is at the given index 
// and the hashpath proves this
// Currently we assume that it is a binary tree, so depth k implies a width of 2^k
// XXX: In the future we can add an arity parameter
