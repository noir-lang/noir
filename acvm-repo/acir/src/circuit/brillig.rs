//! This module contains [Brillig][brillig] structures for integration within an ACIR circuit.
//!
//! [Brillig][brillig] is used in ACIR as a hint for the solver when executing the circuit.
//! Executing Brillig does not generate any constraints and is the result of the compilation of an unconstrained function.
//!
//! Let's see an example with euclidean division.
//! The normal way to compute `a/b`, where `a` and `b` are 8-bits integers, is to
//! implement the Euclidean algorithm which computes in a loop (or recursively)
//! modulus of the kind 'a mod b'. Doing this computation requires a lot of steps to
//! be properly implemented in ACIR, especially the loop with a condition. However,
//! euclidean division can be easily constrained with one assert-zero opcode:
//! `a = bq+r`, assuming `q` is 8 bits and `r<b`. Since these assumptions can easily
//! written with a few range opcodes, euclidean division can in fact be implemented
//! with a small number of opcodes.
//!
//! However, in order to write these opcodes we need the result of the division
//! which are the witness `q` and `r`. But from the constraint `a=bq+r`, how can the
//! solver figure out how to solve `q` and `r` with only one equation? This is where
//! brillig/unconstrained function come into action. We simply define a function that
//! performs the usual Euclidean algorithm to compute `q` and `r` from `a` and `b`.
//! Since executing Brillig does not generate constraints, it is not meaningful to the
//! proving system but simply used by the solver to compute the values of `q` and
//! `r`. The output witnesses `q` and `r` are then expected to be used by the proving system.
//!
//! In summary, executing Brillig will perform the computation defined by its
//! bytecode, on the provided inputs, and assign the result to the output witnesses,
//! without adding any constraints.
