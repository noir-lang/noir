/**
 * @brief ECCVMTranscriptRelationImpl evaluates the correctness of the ECCVM transcript columns
 *
 * @details The transcript relations directly evaluate the correctness of `add, eq, reset` operations.
 * `mul` operations are lazily evaluated. The output of multiscalar multiplications is present in
 * `transcript_msm_x, transcript_msm_y` columns. A set equality check is used to validate these
 * have been correctly read from a table produced by the relations in `ecc_msm_relation.hpp`.
 *
 * Sequential `mul` opcodes are interpreted as a multiscalar multiplication.
 * The column `transcript_msm_count` tracks the number of muls in a given multiscalar multiplication.
 *
 * The column `transcript_pc` tracks a "point counter" value, that describes the number of multiplications
 * that must be evaluated.
 *
 * One mul opcode can generate up to TWO multiplications. Each 128-bit scalar `z1, z2` is treated as an independent
 * mul. The purpose of this is to reduce the length of the MSM algorithm evalauted in `ecc_msm_relation.hpp` to 128
 * bits (from 256 bits). Many scalar muls required to recursively verify a proof are only 128-bits in length; this
 * prevents us doing redundant computation.
